# Recipe Recommender System

## Overview

The Recipe Recommender System is an NLP-based application that generates food recipes based on a list of input ingredients. The system is powered by a fine-tuned BART-base model trained on the RecipeNLG dataset. To make it accessible and user-friendly, weâ€™ve integrated the functionality into a Telegram bot. Users can simply input ingredients into the bot and receive a detailed recipe in response.
